# Project Showcase

This repository showcases some projects (or parts of them) i worked on during the past years.

### 1 Steel Surface Defect Classification
This was a small project during my employment as a research assistant at the University of WÃ¼rzburg under supervision of a PhD student. The main task was to find a dataset related to AI-assisted maintenance or quality assurance in manufacturing, which was then used to develop a classifier model with XAI augmentations. The overall purpose to the PhD student was to have a working example model, on which a user experiment can be built upon. The research purpose was to find out, how the information from the XAI augmentations impacts user confidence and performance of an AI driven decision support system. For me, working on this project gave me the opportunity to learn about and implement explanations for machine learning results, such as SHAP and LIME. Furthermore it gave me a broader perspective on the utility of simple ML models in smart manufacturing, as well as fresh knowledge about the conversion of intially unstructured data such as images into structured tabular data.

### 2 Iris / Credit Risk / Heart Disease Classification
These notebooks were part of my Master's thesis.
